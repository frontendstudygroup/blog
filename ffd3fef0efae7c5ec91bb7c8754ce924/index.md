## About Ophelia
Ophelia is a frontend Blockchain & NFT Engineer, who intends to leverage the power of these technologies to build solutions in Ghana, Africa while constantly striving to give back.

## What?
Cohort based practical learning for beginner developers in WWCode Frontend Track.

## Why?
For a while now, WWCode Frontend has targeted Women with at least a year’s
programming experience. However, now more than ever we see women making a switch
to web development and hence beginning the learning journey. This initiative seeks to
help such women speed up their learning processes, while helping them to gain
confidence through practice.

## Importance of this project:
⁃ New developers build confidence
⁃ Reduces the chances of Imposter Syndrome
⁃ Equips new WWCode Frontend members with basic web development knowledge
and practice before ushering them into the main group. This will enable them to relate
better with content shared and confidently contribute.

## Who?
1. Beginner developers
2. Bootcamp learners/ graduates
3. Self-taught developers

## How?
12 weeks per cohort
<= 10 learners per cohort
