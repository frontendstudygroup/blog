Today we will learn how to make the serverless apps stateful.</p>\n<h2>One new thing to learn this week - Database and serverless functions!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://princiya.com/blog/serverless-react/#overview-of-databases-for-serverless-functions\">Here</a> is an overview of databases for serverless functions.</p>\n<p>I extended the <a href=\"https://princiya.com/blog/serverless-react/\">simple serverless app</a>, which I had created earlier this month, to connect to <a href=\"https://supabase.com/\">Supabase</a> database. This was my first time using Backend as a service and I chose Supabase.</p>\n<p>I followed <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/06/28/saving-data-to-supabase-and-getting-it-back-again/\">this tutorial post</a> to read and save items using Supabase.</p>\n<h3>Three questions to ponder</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is it important to make serverless functions stateful? What happens if serverless functions are stateless?</li>\n<li>What problems do “Database as a service” providers solve as opposed to traditional databases? When did “Database as a service” come into practice?</li>\n<li>How is the serverless architecture?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join our slack channel and we can ponder over these questions together: <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/womenwhocodefrontend/shared_invite/zt-gaic5y90-pDJK4H_NbObZ_MU_rcYc0A\">https://join.slack.com/t/womenwhocodefrontend/shared_invite/zt-gaic5y90-pDJK4H_NbObZ_MU_rcYc0A</a></p>\n<h2>Community showcase</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../jan-14-nayeon-shin/\">Nayeon Shin - Building a productivity app in Vanilla JS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../jan-18-damilola-ale/\">Damilola Ale - An introduction to React and Firebase</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/farhanaxmustafa/a-mental-health-journey-as-a-software-engineer-g48\">Farhana - A Mental Health Journey as a Software Engineer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://princiya.com/blog/serverless-react/\">Princiya Sequeira - Serverless React</a></li>\n<li>Question from the community: <a href=\"https://princiya.com/blog/docker-k8s-for-frontend/\">Is Docker, Kubernetes necessary for frontend development</a></li>\n<li>Advice for the community: <a href=\"https://princiya.com/blog/how-to-learn\">How to learn</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"What to learn - Issue 2","date":"January 19, 2022","time":null,"description":"More on serverless.
