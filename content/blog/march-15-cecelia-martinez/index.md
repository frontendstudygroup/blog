This event is BYOB (Bring Your Own Bugs!).

Investigating and fixing bugs in your application can feel like a frustrating and daunting process.  With the right approach, debugging can actually help you better understand you codebase and be more confident to fix bugs fast. We'll cover debugging best practices and debug some issues together live! Submit your GitHub issues in advance in `#byob` slack channel to have your issue reviewed during the webinar.
