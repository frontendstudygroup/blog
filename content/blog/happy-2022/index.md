We are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream! WWCode Frontend wishes you all a great 2022 ahead.
Stay happy and healthy! ðŸŽ‰ âœ¨

We have been planning on events and content for 2022, and we cannot wait to share with you all.

## 2021 Highlights

- WWCode Frontend technical track has neared 3000 members! We are growing in numbers and engagement on social media too.
- We had a great [Hacktoberfest studygroup event](/weekly-wrap-october-24/) and [chat show series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfL0Q83beNI&list=PLVcEZG2JPVhdJVopX9jAM8PUCaC7qKOgp&index=54).
