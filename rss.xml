For a first timer, this event was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya.com/blog/thankful/#time-management&quot;&gt;Princiya Sequeira&lt;/a&gt;, also realised that I could not continue at this pace alone and decided to pause events for the WWCode Frontend track for November 2021 and focus on onboarding volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Volunteer management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of November went talking to new and old volunteers, understanding their motivations, it also became clear that onboarding volunteers takes much longer time than anticipated. As leadership fellows we work around ~10 hours/week and within this time it is extremely difficult to do everything. Volunteer management and event management are two full time job roles and hence I decided to onboard volunteers passively, give them time to figure out what they are interested in. Volunteers also need to be nurtured, mentored and groomed so that they can do their volunteering activities. Timezone differences is another challenge. Also given the upcoming December holiday season I also noticed that volunteers could not commit yet and hence it made sense to give them time and space to let them explore and get back to me about what they want to do. Currently, we have few volunteers who are working in the background and we will announce and promote them in January 2022!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DSA study group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSA study group did not work like expected and we have paused this for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social media activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 2 volunteers, Kaleigh Scruggs and Faith Pueneh looking after wednesday motivation and friday feelings posts. We will announce them in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Event management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event line up for December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.canva.com/design/DAExw6XAQ-o/YYFSdiaFi-ju6QAYJAF3XQ/view&quot; alt=&quot;December events&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed 3 months as a leadership fellow and I wrote my reflections in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya.com/blog/thankful/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I am happy and I am looking forward to 2022 as we have been chalking out several new ideas and initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekly wrap up - October 24, 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Opensource study group We kicked off the opensource study group for WWCode Frontend on October 1, 2021.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We kicked off the opensource study group for &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenwhocode.com/frontend&quot;&gt;WWCode Frontend&lt;/a&gt; on October 1, 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then we have had 25 pull requests merged and the community engagement has been great. ~10 pull requests merged during the second week. 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/frontendstudygroup&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are the repositories for contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study group observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am overall happy with the outcome of the study group itself. Week 1 was busy, since this was a new thing, folks were excited and the “getting into” phase was relatively easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the weeks lot of pull requests got merged and this was a good collaboration for folks learning opensource for the first time, understand how things work and also how to take up different things and work in parallel together with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study group #applaud-her ✨&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To everyone who contributed to the studygroup repositories - both code and blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The opensource chat show - Episode 2 and Episode 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVcEZG2JPVhdikCnEeGTOcRNzE28-k-_E&quot;&gt;Youtube Hacktoberfest 2021 playlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first episode we discussed tips on how to make the most out of your opensource contributions, why it is important to have a motivation which will in turn help you better decide what you want to do and also how to be a little selfish in choosing what you want to do with opensource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2nd episode we discussed tips about how to pick an opensource project itself, not to be overwhelmed and also learned about opensource licenses. The key message from our speakers was that opensource is for everyone, and not to restrict yourself. Patience is the key, sky is the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 3rd episode of the opensource chat show we spoke in particular about the different types of opensource contributions you can make, which are not just limited to writing code. Both our speakers had lot of useful insights to share about their opensource journeys and how they contributed to opensource in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up another great 4th episode of the chat show on October 22, 2021. We heard more insightful and exciting stories and speakers had great advice for first time contributors and how to work better in a remote setup and with remote timezones. The video recording will be uploaded into Youtube shortly. Stay tuned or follow our blog updates…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contributing to open source can be daunting for a lot of people, at least I know it was for me. Although I wanted to contribute to open source, I was not sure how to go about it. I finally took the plunge during Hacktoberfest 2021 and made my first open source contribution, and you can too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What even is Open Source? 🤔&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source Software(OSS) is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, enhance and distribute under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical&quot;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the technologies that we use today, such as Android, Firefox, Git, Linux, TypeScript and VLC media player are built on OSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source code is usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. Although the primary goal of open source projects is to create valuable and accessible open source software, it is also beneficial to its contributors. Benefits of contributing to open source include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honing one’s technical skills by getting the opportunity to work on real-world projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving soft skills such as communication and giving/receiving feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting new people and expanding your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…and Hacktoberfest? 🧐&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are that you’ve seen the word ‘Hacktoberfest’ come up a lot especially in the month of October. While contributions to open source can be made any time, Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;. Hacktoberfest aims to promote, celebrate and encourage people to contribute to open source. It is a great time to get started with open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate, sign up on the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;  website between October 1st and October 31st. This ensures that your contributions count. A participant has to make four(4) valid pull requests in participating GitHub or GitLab repositories. Participating repositories are labelled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hacktoberfest&lt;/code&gt;, alternatively, merged pull requests can also be labelled &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hacktoberfest-accepted&lt;/code&gt; to participate. Once these 4 pull requests are merged into the repositories and pass the fourteen(14) day review period, a participant is eligible to win swags which include, a T-shirt and limited edition stickers or could choose to plant a tree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Projects to Contribute To&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where it might get a little intimidating at first as a lot of projects can seem complex. Do not fret, there are a number of ways to find projects that are of interest to you and are on your skill level to ease you in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developer Communities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer communities provide a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other, stay up-to-date and grow. These communities can be very beneficial to starting your open source journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwhocode.com/frontend&quot;&gt;Women Who Code Frontend&lt;/a&gt; started a dedicated study group &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/frontendstudygroup/frontendstudygroup.github.io&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to learn about front end technologies as well as how to collaborate on an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first open source contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an existing issue, issue #2 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Design the header&lt;/code&gt;. It was just the right one as implementing an header is something I have experience working on. Per the rules of the project, I commented on the issue of my proposed plans, asked for feedback and politely requested to be assigned the issue. I soon got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on issue #2, not only did I learn something technically—a new css hover effect, it further reinforced to me how important communication and collaboration are, especially working with people for the first-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has been super open(pun fully intended 😏), helpful and supportive. In addition to creating the study group project, a blog has also been created and webinars organized weekly through out the month of October to discuss open source! I honestly couldn’t have asked for a better first contribution as it helped boost my confidence to further participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media and Online Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my second contribution, while browsing through the hacktoberfest hashtag on Twitter, I saw several tweets calling for contributors to open source repositories. I soon found one that aligned with my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent contributions have come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodfirstissues.com/&quot;&gt;goodfirstissues.com&lt;/a&gt;, this is a website that aggregates beginner-friendly, open source repositories looking for help.  You can filter according to language, label and repository, making it even easier to find issues to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other websites to find repositories to contribute to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codetriage.com&quot;&gt;codetriage.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goodfirstissue.dev&quot;&gt;goodfirstissue.dev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://up-for-grabs.net&quot;&gt;up-for-grabs.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is a great way to find open source projects to work on. You can take advantage of GitHub’s advanced search feature and prefixes to improve your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search can be filtered based on many factors such as issue label, language, number of forks and so on. Labels to search for as a beginner include &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;help-wanted&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;first-timers-only&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;good-first-bug&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing to Your First Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source is not limited to writing code. You can contribute by improving the documentation, opening issues, or labeling pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects will have guidelines specific to the project. These can usually be found in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt; file. Make sure to read the whole document thoroughly and be sure that you’re following guidelines that project maintainers have specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After choosing an open source project to work on, there are a few ways you can decide on what you would like to contribute to the project. You can work on pre-existing issues which can be found under the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Issues&lt;/code&gt; tab on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find an issue that you’re interested in, it is best to comment on the issue outlining how you’d go about implementing a solution. In some cases, you can ask to be assigned the issue. It is important to be polite in your communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also create a new issue based on a bug you’ve noticed or a feature you think needs to be
implemented or improved upon. Keep in mind that the decision to approve your new issue is ultimately at the discretion of the project maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve decided on an issue to work one, you can start the process of contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fork the Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make a copy of the original repository. That means you can make any changes you want to the forked repository, without affecting the original one.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your local machine, run the following Git command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;your_profile_name&gt;/&amp;lt;repo_name&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clones the repository on your machine so you can work on it. You can then open the repository in your code editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a Branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start working, create a separate branch that will hold all the code that you add or edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create a branch by running the following Git command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git checkout -b &amp;lt;branch_name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can make code changes, update the documentation, organize the files, or anything else!
All contributions are important and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commit and Push your Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are satisfied with your code, you can commit and push your changes to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git add .
git commit -m &apos;commit message&apos;
git push -u origin &amp;lt;your_branch_name&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create a Pull Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;New pull request&lt;/code&gt; button under the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Pull requests&lt;/code&gt; tab in your forked repository on the GitHub. GitHub will automatically compare your changes to the original repository. You will also be shown a text editor. Fill this in with the relevant information needed to understand the work you’ve just done. Click the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Create pull request&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! You have made changes and just created a pull request. 👏🏾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait for the project maintainer(s) to review your changes. Upon review, you may be requested to make changes to the work you’ve done. If all goes well, your pull request will be approved and the project maintainer(s) will merge your contributions into the codebase. You’ll officially become an open source contributor! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source contribution for me has been an amazing and rewarding learning experience. I hope this post helps to give a better understanding of open source and inspires you to get involved. It might take a few tries to fully put your skills to use, but there is a place for everyone willing to contribute to open source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekly wrap up - October 11, 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Past meeting notes can be found here.

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I (&lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya.com&quot;&gt;Princiya Sequeira&lt;/a&gt;, Women Who Code Leadership Fellow for Frontend) will publish our weekly updates here in this blog. Before we get started with the updates for the first week of October, here is a quick recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined WWCode team as a Leadership Fellow for Frontend on August 23, 2021. Today is Week 8 since I joined the team in part-time capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My personal goal for this fellowship is to increase the community activity and engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Week 1: October 1 - 10, 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opensource study group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We kicked off the opensource study group for &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenwhocode.com/frontend&quot;&gt;WWCode Frontend&lt;/a&gt; on October 1, 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then we have had 15 pull requests merged and the community engagement has been great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/frontendstudygroup&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are the repositories for contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/838623a22d7ecc0e6de58ac1bc7b0982/page.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Week 1 updates to the study group website&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study group expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-iterating the study group expectations which we have also outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/frontendstudygroup/frontendstudygroup.github.io#expectations&quot;&gt;project’s readme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participation and maintenance of this project is completely voluntary and &lt;strong&gt;we are not committing to teach anything&lt;/strong&gt; as part of this effort.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to practice together with us, this is a good place!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We highly encourage you not to use third party UI frameworks. For example, if you want to design a carousel or a tooltip, do it from scratch.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However we do understand that sometimes we need to use some third party libraries like redux or react-dom-router. When in doubt discuss it on the issue you are working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your own motivation to contribute to this repository and make sure you have the time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life happens, we get it. Just let us know if you cannot do something you’re assigned to and do NOT feel guilty about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things work best for all of us when contribution goals are driven by you&lt;/strong&gt;. We as maintainers will only guide you and validate your thought process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be open and honest in your communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be selfish! Aim to do what you intend to learn and do not feel forced to work on something against your will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study group observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; seems to be everyone’s favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem with CSS is that you can achieve the desired layout without even attempting to learn how CSS works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw lot of folks resorting to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; and I had to explicitly tell many times why &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; css property is not an ideal choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We follow a &lt;strong&gt;“mentee driven approach”&lt;/strong&gt; which we have also highlighted in the above &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;expectations&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So if you are reading this post and curious to learn why &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; is not an ideal choice, I strongly suggest to read up on this and then share your learnings as a new blog post to this study group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bet you will be very happy to know that you would have enhanced your CSS skills :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study group #applaud-her ✨&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Women Who Code has an active culture of showing appreciations and applauding folks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study group has been successful in its first week due to all active contributors and keeping the contributions flowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, I would like to #applaud-her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sunithapateldev&quot;&gt;Sunitha Patel&lt;/a&gt; who has been so active in the slack group and in the Github repository. She has been also collaborating with the Women Who Code Cloud track in bringing in the cloud related issues and extending the scope of our study group web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you 😍 Sunitha Patel 😍 for your awesome spirit and helping our community learn and grow. She is also starting a new job at Shopify today and we wish her nothing but the best. WomenWhoCode and Shopify are both lucky to have you. Rise and shine ✨.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The opensource chat show - Episode 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;./how-to-ace-hacktoberfest&quot;&gt;first episode&lt;/a&gt; we discussed tips on how to make the most out of the hacktoberfest month or through your opensource contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2nd episode we discussed tips about how to pick an opensource project itself, not to be overwhelmed and also learn about opensource licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had Kavya Jaiswal and Pragati Verma join us and tell us about their opensource adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to have a personal goal so that you can narrow down your searches and find a good first project for contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opensource is for everyone,don’t restrict yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience is the key, sky is the limit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tip #1: Find your motivation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is that you wish to learn or gain from being an open-source contributor? Do you want to prepare for an upcoming opensource internship? Or are you working at a startup but want to find out what it is like to contribute to Facebook, Microsoft, or Google? Have you had a pause in your career and want to use opensource as a career bridge or want to upskill yourself but being an opensource contributor? The reasons can be many, but you need to find your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the motivation is clear, it gets easier to choose a project, and filter projects belonging to certain companies or based on your preferred tech stack, interests, and matching skill sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tip #2: Manage your time wisely&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the time to work on opensource itself can be very challenging. Not everyone gets to work at a company that allows contributing to opensource as part of the daily work. Or you might be a student and have to balance college work plus internships and other side projects. Time indeed is a crucial factor but as long as you have good Motivation (which is tip 1, find your motivation) you can find ways to make the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tip #3: Be honest and open in your communication&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in the open means you also have to learn how to communicate in the open. You will be collaborating with people across multiple time zones and cultures. Ask questions when things are not clear. Detail your thought process. Do not be shy. Things can be overwhelming, which is totally normal and fine. If you don’t find the time to work on a claimed issue, it’s fine! But be honest about this and let others know so that someone else can pick up this issue. Find your support group or a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenwhocode.com/frontend&quot;&gt;WomenWhoCode Frontend&lt;/a&gt; track are running an active study group for folks to get comfortable in learning to work in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tip #4: Be selfish&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a bonus tip: Be selfish! Yes, you read it right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opensource can be used in multiple ways, that’s why tip 1 is very important, find your motivation.
Come up with ideas so that you can use opensource to fulfill your motivation, and that’s why to be selfish. You don’t have to do the tasks which others want you to do, instead, you can pick up tasks that you want to learn and fulfill your motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to make the most out of this hacktoberfest month -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to have a personal motivation. Motivation is found when the purpose is discovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also important to have a supportive environment to find the time to contribute; be it a supporting employer, family, or university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to get used to the culture of working in open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are bound to find good as well as bad people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing is easy, and opensource is not easy too :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish you all the best for Hacktoberfest!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Opensource Chat Show 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[WomenWhoCode Frontend presents - “The Opensource Chat Show”.
